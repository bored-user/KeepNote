<title>Convention</title>
</head><body>Following Ruby's convention rules, every method that ends in a question mark (e.g.: include?) is like a yes or no question. It returns true or false.<br/>
<br/>
Also, every method that ends in an exclamation mark (e.g.: sort!) will modify the data structure it was called on. Almost all methods that modifies the data structure have an non-modiff version (e.g.: sort! and sort). There are four I know that do not ends in an exclamation mark but do modify the data structure: push, pop, shift and unshift.</body></html>
