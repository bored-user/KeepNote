<title>Defining a block</title>
</head><body>There are basically two ways to define a block: the short and the long way.<br/>
<br/>
The long way is writting the commands between do/ end statements (I know, you've seen this on the each loop method, right?).<br/>
The short way is writting the commands (separated by semicolons) on a single line between curly brakcets.<br/>
<br/>
By convention, one should only use the short method when there's only a single line to be ran.</body></html>
