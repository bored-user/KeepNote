<title>Loading files</title>
</head><body>The load function reads and parses a file everytime one calls the load function.<br/>
The require function also reads a file but it does it only once (the first time you call the function).<br/>
<br/>
The difference between them is the same difference as require and require_once.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's also the require_relative function which is a modification of the require one. require_relative imports a file relative to the path of the file that's running the require command. Shortly: it's better to use require_relative to import files and require to import gems.</body></html>
