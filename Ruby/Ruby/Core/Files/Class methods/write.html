     <h1>write</h1>

    <p><code>write</code> is a method that can be called on the File object. It
      writes content to a file.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-ruby">File.write('file', 'content')</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It can be also called on a File instance</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-ruby">f = File.new('file', 'r')
puts f.write('a')
f.close # write changes to file</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The difference between both methods is that the first writes content directly,
      while the second will only write the contents to the file after the <a href="../Instance%20methods/close.html"><code>close</code></a> method
      is called.</p>
