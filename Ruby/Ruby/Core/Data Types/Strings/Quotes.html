     <h1>Quotes</h1>

    <p>In Ruby, it's possible to use both single and double quotes to indicate
      strings.
      <br>However, there's a limitation when using single quotes.
      <br>
      <br>When using single quotes, one cannot use special formatting, like "\n"
      to indicate a line break, or string <a href="Interpolation.html">interpolation</a>.
      <br>
      <br>Therefore, both "Hello, World!" and 'Hello, World!' are perfectly accepted.</p>
