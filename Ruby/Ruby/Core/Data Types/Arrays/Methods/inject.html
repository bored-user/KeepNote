     <h1>inject</h1>

    <p>Acts like JavaScript array: takes an accumulator as first argument and
      a block as “second”.</p>
    <section class="include-note" data-note-id="tAR43d5ILaVT"
    data-box-size="full">&nbsp;</section>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When no argument is given as accumulator, the method starts at array index
      1 and the accumulator turns to the 1st array element (index 0).</p>

    class="include-note" data-note-id="w6BlfNGC9v1n" data-box-size="full">&nbsp;</section>

      <p>Because Ruby uses <code>:+</code> and <code>:*</code> as the symbols for the
        addition and multiplication operations, it's possible to dry that code
        a little:</p>

      data-box-size="full">&nbsp;</section>
