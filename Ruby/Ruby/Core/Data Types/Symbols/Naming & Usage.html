     <h1>Naming &amp; Usage</h1>

    <p>Following Ruby conventions, a symbol shouldn't contain spaces, because
      it's harder to write (although it's possible: <code>:"my symbol"</code>).</p>
    <p>A Symbol cannot contain hyphens (unless its name is a string, just like
      with space characters) but can contain underscores.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One can use a symbol using <code>:symbol</code>, where “symbol” is the
      symbol name.</p>
