<title>Pointers</title>
</head><body>Just like on JavaScript, Julia stores, in a variable, a pointer to an object in memory.<br/>
So, if one sets a variable "x" to &nbsp;variable "y" which has an object assign to it, Julia won't copy the whole object again. In fact, it'll only create another pointer to that object in memory.<br/>
In order to really copy an object, one must use the copy() function.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
a = [1, 2, 3]<br/>
b = a<br/>
c = copy(a)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a[1] = 'a'<br/>
println(a)&#09;&#09;# ['a', 2, 3]<br/>
println(b)&#09;&#09;# ['a', 2, 3]&#09;it's only a pointer to the data in memory, so modifying 'a' modifies 'b' indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
println(c)&#09;&#09;# [1, 2, 3]&#09;it was copied using copy(), that's why it's unchanged.</body></html>
