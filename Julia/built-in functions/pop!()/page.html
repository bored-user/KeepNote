<title>pop!()</title>
</head><body>Removes a element (identified by the key) from a data structure. Returns the removed element.<br/>
Takes, as 1st parameter, the data structure and, as (optional) 2nd, the key to remove.<br/>
If there's no second parameter (key), it'll remove the last element.<br/>
ATTENTION: it modifies the data structure.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
dict1 = Dict("key1" =&gt; "value1", "key2" =&gt; "value2")<br/>
println(dict1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # has both "key1" and "key2" as entries.<br/>
pop!(dict1, "key2")<br/>
println(dict1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # has only "key1"</body></html>
