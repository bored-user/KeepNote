<title>rect()</title>
</head><body>rect() is used to draw a rectangle on a canvas.<br/>
It takes at least four arguments: the x-axis and y-axis position of the rectangle, it's width and it's height.<br/>
<br/>
It can also take some optional arguments: the rectangle border radius.<br/>
One can give from 1 to 4 border-radius parameters. The first defines the top-left, the 2nd, the top-right; then the bottom-right and bottom-left. If you pass less than 4 parameters, the other borders will have the default radius value (0).<br/>
<br/>
Quick note: the 0x0 point on webpages is the top-left corner.</body></html>
