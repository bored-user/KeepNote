</head><body>When one uses the same color of R, G and B (on an RGB scale), they create what is known by &quot;greyscale color&quot;.<br/>
p5.js anad Processing lets you simlify that on all color functions by just writting it one time.<br/>
So, if one wants a white background, they should use background(255). Or a black stroke? stroke(0) (which is equivalent to stroke(0,0,0)). </body></html>
