<title>draw()</title>
</head><body>The draw() function, on the other way, is executing constantly, in a loop.<br/>
<br/>
In order to &quot;delete&quot; everything that's drawn on screen, there's a need to use the background() function on the draw(). If one uses it on the setup() function, it would happen only once and every new thing that's being drawn on screen would overlap the existant shapes and objects.</body></html>
