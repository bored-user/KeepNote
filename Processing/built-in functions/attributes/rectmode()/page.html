<title>rectMode()</title>
</head><body>The way to align things (shapes).<br/>
<br/>
The default value is CORNER. This means that if you place a rectangle at the &quot;center&quot; of the screen but it's rectMode() is set to CORNER (or not set at all since it's the default value), it WON'T BE at the center of the screen. IT'S TOP-LEFT CORNER WILL.<br/>
<br/>
So, in order to solve that, one should use the rectMode(CENTER) (to have the alignment calculated relative to the rectangle's center) before drawing the rectangle itself.</body></html>
