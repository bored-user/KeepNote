     <h1>Static</h1>

    <p>Static methods are a way of executing class methods without having to
      instantiate them. It also allows the system to store that method in only
      one place (because the class objects will only have a pointer to the method,
      not the method itself).</p>
    <p>They're useful when the method doesn't depend on the object (roughly speaking,
      it doesn't modify <code>this</code> variables).</p>
