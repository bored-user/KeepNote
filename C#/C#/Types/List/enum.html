     <h1>enum</h1>

    <p>An enum is a set of related constants in form of key/value pairs.</p>
    <p>An enum is defined outside any method (on the class root). It's values
      can be byte, short, int or long (and their <a href="../Primitive%20types/Signed%20vs%20Unsigned.html">and their signed/unsigned versions</a>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <section class="include-note" data-note-id="oCaIRvtMke0D" data-box-size="full">&nbsp;</section>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note the <code>: int</code>. That's how one can define the enum value's
      type. Also, it's not necessary to define the enum key values (if no value
      is set, the fist will be zero and the others will be incremented by one),
      but it is, however, a good practice to do it.</p>
