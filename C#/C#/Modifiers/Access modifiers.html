     <h1>Access modifiers</h1>

    <p>One of the pillars of OOP is encapsulation. That means that only the minimum
      necessary should be visible to external parts of the code.</p>
    <p>In this sense, there are access modifiers. They define how visible a property
      or method should be to the external world.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this sense, properties defined with the <code>private</code> access modifiers
      should implement getters and setters, which are basically public methods
      that will set/ return the value of said property on demand. That's where
