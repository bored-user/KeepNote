<title>The PHP</title>
</head><body>There's a built-in variable called $_FILE. It's actually a built-in array.<br/>
It is used to get the information on submitted files.<br/>
It returns the name of the file, it's MIME type, it's tmp_name (path on user's computer on a tmp folder), a possible error (boolean) and it's size in bytes.<br/>
<br/>
It's index is the *name* of the input:file on the HTML side. So if you use "&lt;input type='file' name='myFile'&gt;", the $_FILES index is myFile.<br/>
<br/>
Then, a function named move_uploaded_file() is used to move the uploaded file somewhere on the website. It takes 2 parameters: the original tmp destination ($_FILES["myFile]["tmp_name"]) and the permanent one (remembering that the / on PHP is the "absolute root" of the server, not the website root).</body></html>
