<title>glob()</title>
</head><body>glob() is a function used to find files matching a specific string.<br/>
It takes the file name as its single parameter.<br/>
<br/>
In case it returns two results (see explanation below) the first will always be the right one.<br/>
If one searches a file named "profile1.jpg" and there's another file named "profile11.jpg", glob will return an array which's first index is "profile1.jpg", which is the wanted one.</body></html>
