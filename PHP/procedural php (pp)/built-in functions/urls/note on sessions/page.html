<title>Note on SESSIONS</title>
</head><body>One can use a query string to give to another page access to sessions.<br/>
The developer should pass the PHPSESSID and the session_id() function result as value.<br/>
<br/>
This should only be used when cookies are disabled (when cookies are disabled, the webpage which set the SESSION can still access it; but other webpages on the same server cannot - since every SESSION is basically a cookie with expiration date = when the browser closes).</body></html>
