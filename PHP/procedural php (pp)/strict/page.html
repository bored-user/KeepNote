<title>Strict</title>
</head><body>One can specify the type of data which a function will recieve as argument, using the typename keyword, just like in C#.<br/>
For instance, if a function can only get an integer as parameter, one may use "function myFunction(int $myArg) {}". That means that PHP will throw an error if the data given isn't the specified one.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there's something called strict declaration which will FORCE PHP to throw the error. In that integer example above, one may give "2" (which is technically a string) but PHP will convert it to an integer and won't throw any error.<br/>
<br/>
The same problem may also happen in the wanted data is a string but the user passes the number 4 as an argument. PHP will convert the integer "4" to the string "4".<br/>
<br/>
The programmer may avoid this by declaring strict_types predefined constant to 1, using "declare(strict_types = 1)". This will not allow PHP to automatically convert data types (like the ones on the examples above).</body></html>
