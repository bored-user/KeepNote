<title>While/ Do While</title>
</head><body>The while loop execute the commands given while the given condition is true.<br/>
One should use some kind of exit condition.<br/>
<br/>
while (true) will execute forever.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
$myVar = 0<br/>
while ($myVar &lt;= 10) {<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">commands;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">$myVar++</li>
</ul>
}<br/>
<br/>
On the first loop, myVar will be 0. Then it'll turn to 1. And 2. And 3... And 9. And finally 10, exitting the while loop (since the condition is false).<br/>
<br/>
The do while will first execute and only then check the condition.<br/>
It'll certainly execute at least once.</body></html>
