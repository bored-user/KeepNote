<title>Extending</title>
</head><body>Class extending is done by the keyword "extends".<br/>
It means that every method and property available on a class will be inherited to the other class.<br/>
<br/>
So if there's a property named "prop1" on "class1" it can be accessed by (if it's visibility is set to public or protected) "class2" using "Class class2 extends class1" (on the class2 declaration statement).</body></html>
