<title>Note on AC and interfaces</title>
</head><body><br/>
Inheritance is the notion to extend from something, and optionally add some new feature or override some existing feature (to do differently). But using inheritance, you share a big part of code with the parent. <b>You are</b>&nbsp;a parent + some other things.<br/>
<br/>
Interface is representing some abilities (we says a class is <i>implementing</i>&nbsp;an interface to says that it has these abilities). An interface can be implemented by 2 classes which are completely different and do not share their code (except for methods they implements). When A and B are implementing interface C, A is not a B and B is not a A.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
And one of the reason for interface is indeed to allow programmer to do the same as they could do with multi-inheritance, but without multi-inheritance problems.<br/>
