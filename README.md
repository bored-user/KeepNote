# notes

This is where I store notes on the programming languages (and some other things) I'm currently learning/ have learned.<br>
You may find that the structure of some subdirectories may vary - that's because I used to write my notes on [KeepNote](https://github.com/mdrasmus/keepnote) application, but it went unmainted so I switched to [Trillium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).

I hope you find this useful somehow.<br>
Happy coding!
