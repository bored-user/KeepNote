</head><body>The &lt;sup&gt; tag creates a sobescript.<br/>
It basically means a text that's smaller and is positioned on the bottom of the others, just like the chemical formulas.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that the round part on the letter "b" (sub) is located on the lower part of it.<br/>
Therefore the &lt;sub&gt; tag makes text go down (subescript).</body></html>
