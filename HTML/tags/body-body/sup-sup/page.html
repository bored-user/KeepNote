</head><body>The &lt;sup&gt; tag creates a superscript.<br/>
It basically means a text that's smaller and is positioned on top of the others, just like the "st" on 1st.<br/>
<br/>
Just remember that the round part on the letter "p" (sup) is located on the upper part of it.<br/>
Therefore the &lt;sup&gt; tag makes text go up (superscript).</body></html>
