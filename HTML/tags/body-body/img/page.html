</head><body>The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to insert an image into the webpage.<br/>
It has three main attributes: src (source), alt (alternative) and title.<br/>
<br/>
The src specifies the source of the image; where it'll be loaded from.<br/>
The alt is a mandatory attribute (by the syntax rules of W3C). It specifies an alternative text to be displayed if the image isn't avalilable.<br/>
The title specifies the image title. It creates that beautiful placeholder shown when the mouse is kept on top of the image for some seconds.</body></html>
