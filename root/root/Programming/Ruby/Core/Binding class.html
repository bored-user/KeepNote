     <h1>Binding class</h1>

    <p>The binding class is a way to access local variables on the global scope.
      It creates an anchor on the code, allowing one to access the variables
      later on.</p>
    <p>After the binding method is used, the <a href="Functions/Methods/class.html">function's class</a> (where
      said binding method was called) turns to <code>BindingClass</code>.</p>
