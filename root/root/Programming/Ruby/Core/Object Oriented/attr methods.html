     <h1>attr methods</h1>

    <p>The attr methods are a way to easily make attributes. They automatically
      creates the getters and setters functions.</p>
    <p>There are three different types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>attr_reader</code>
      </li>
      <li><code>attr_writer</code>
      </li>
      <li><code>attr_accessor</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first one is used when one wants to create only the method which returns
      the instance variable equivalent to its name (basically, only read it).</p>
    <p>The second one is used when one wants to create only the <code>name=</code> method,
      which allows the programmer to modify the attribute value (but not read
      it).</p>
    <p>The third one is a combination of the other two. It allows one to read
      and write the attribute value.</p>
    <p>The syntax is the same for all three: one calls the method giving a Symbol
      with the attribute name as argument. It's possible to give more than one
      argument.</p>
