     <h1>Indef. plural</h1>

    <p>The indefinite plural form convention is the way of pluralizing indefinite
      <a
      href="../../../../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)">nouns</a>. It basically consist in adding the letters “r” (in most cases:
        if the noun ends in a vowel) or “er” (in most cases: &nbsp;if they end
        in a consonant other than “r”) at the end of the noun (unless they're
        <a
        href="../../../../Artikler%20(Articles)/List/Et.html">neutral</a>- which doesn't add any letters).</p>
    <p>For instance: “<a href="../../../__Animals__%20%20(Dyr)/en%20katt%20(a%20cat)">katt</a>”
      means “cat”, while “katter” means “cats”. There are, however, irregular
      plural nouns, like “<a href="../../../__People__/en%20mann%20(a%20man)">mann</a>”
      ("man"), which becomes “menn” ("men"), instead of “manner” (which would
      be the regular form).</p>
