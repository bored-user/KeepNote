     <h1>Definite plural</h1>

    <p>The definite plural form convention is the way of defining plural <a href="../../../../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)">nouns</a>.
      It basically consist in pluralizing the noun and replacing the “er” ending
      with the letters “ene” or “ne” - if the noun already ends in “e” or “r”
      (or even “a” if the noun is <a href="../../../../Artikler%20(Articles)/List/Et.html">neutral</a>,
      even though the first is more common).</p>
    <p>For instance: “<a href="../../Katt%20(Cat).html">katt</a>” means “cat”,
      while “kattene” means “the cats”. There are, however, irregular plural
      nouns, like “<a href="../../../__People__/Mann%20(Man)">mann</a>” ("man"),
      which becomes “mennene” ("men").</p>
