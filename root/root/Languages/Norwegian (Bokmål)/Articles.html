     <h1>Articles</h1>

    <p>Note that, even though there are three articles that mean “a”/ “an”/ “one”
      ("<a href="Articles/List/En.html">en</a>", “<a href="Articles/List/Et.html">et</a>”,
      “<a href="Articles/List/Ei.html">ei</a>”), there is no clear rule where
      to use each of them.</p>
    <p>It's more of a memorization thing. For instace: “<a href="Articles/List/En.html">en</a> 
      <a
      href="Nouns/__People__/Barn.html">barn</a>” ("a kid") is correct even though “<a href="Nouns/__People__/Barn.html">barn</a>”
        is a gender-neutral word (which would mean that the correct form is “
        <a
        href="Articles/List/Et.html">et</a> <a href="Nouns/__People__/Barn.html">barn</a>”).</p>
