     <h1>Til (More)</h1>

    <p>“Til” is “More” in the sense of “More one”/ “More two”/ etc.</p>
    <p>If you want more of something countable, you can use the adverb "til".
      You then combine it with a number: “en til” becomes “one more” or “another”,
      “to til” becomes “two more”, and so on.</p>
    <p>When specifying exactly what you want, by adding a noun, the number goes
      before the noun, while “til” goes after, like so: “<a href="../Artikler%20(Articles)/List/En.html">en</a> 
      <a
      href="../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)/__Things__/Kopp%20(Cup)">kopp</a>til” ("one more cup").</p>
