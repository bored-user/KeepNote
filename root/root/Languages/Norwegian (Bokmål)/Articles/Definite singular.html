     <h1>Definite singular</h1>

    <p>The definite singular form convention is the way of defining singular
      <a
      href="../Nouns">nouns</a>. It basically consist in adding the noun's article at its end,
        creating a new (definite) noun.</p>
    <p>For instance: “<a href="List/En.html">en</a>  <a href="../Nouns/__People__/Mann.html">mann</a>”
      means “a man”, while “mannen” means “the man”. There are, however, irregular
      definite nouns, like “<a href="List/En.html">en</a>  <a href="../Nouns/__People__/Jente.html">jente</a>”
      ("a girl"), which becomes “jenta” ("the girl"), instead of “jenteen” (which
      would be the regular form).</p>
