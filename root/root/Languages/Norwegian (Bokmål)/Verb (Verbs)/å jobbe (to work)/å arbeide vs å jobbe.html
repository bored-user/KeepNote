     <h1>å arbeide vs å jobbe</h1>

    <p>While “å arbeide” are considered more formal than “å jobbe”, “å jobbe”
      is actually more used (mainly when used in a “where do you work?” context).</p>
    <p>Note that “å arbeide” forms the word “arbeider” ("worker"), however, there's
      no “jobber”.</p>
