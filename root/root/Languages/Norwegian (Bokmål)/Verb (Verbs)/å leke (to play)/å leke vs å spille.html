     <h1>å leke vs å spille</h1>

    <p>While “<a href="../%C3%A5%20leke%20(to%20play)">å leke</a>" is used on
      more general playing (like kids on a playground), “<a href="../%C3%A5%20spille%20(to%20play)">å spille</a>”
      is used on rule-based games. For instance: one can “spille” the chess and
      “leke” hide and seek.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, “spille” is used for computer games, sports and instruments;
      while “leke” is more for child-related games. Note, however, that the Olympic
      Games are “leke(d)” instead of “spille(d)”.</p>
